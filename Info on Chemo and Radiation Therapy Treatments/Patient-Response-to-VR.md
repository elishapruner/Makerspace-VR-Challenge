Thoughts from Terry’s sisters:

I base my response on having been a cancer patient and experiencing virtual
reality technology with my sons games. Personally I have always wanted to know
exactly what is wrong and how to fix it. If a cancer patient can see and truly
see what is going on then I feel the “fear of the unknown” will help alleviate
those fears and then you can concentrate on how to get better and seek the best
treatment available. I do believe however that age has an affect on a patients
behavior - the older generations want things to go away and the details of how
it got there are not important to them and the fear takes over rational thought.

When I experienced my sons virtual reality headset I was transformed into a
world that seemed so real and amazing that I did in fact feel transformed. In
one game I played I was tricked into believing that I was actually jumping off
a cliff. But once I did jump and realized I was ok that gave me the confidence
to move on just like in real life so I think how amazing that would be if I was
a patient and could actually see the kind of cancer, where it is and how it
will be treated. I truly feel VR can motivate behavior and therefore reduce
anxiety and aid in understanding treatment and recovery. Even as a doctor I can
imagine that using VR would help alleviate their challenge of trying to explain
a diagnosis without been too clinical.

When I received chemotherapy treatments I think the worst part was really the
length of time you lay there waiting for the treatment - remaining positive is
a challenge - so if VR was introduced for not only diagnosis but for treatment
as well I believe that would be very beneficial. Who would not want to be
transformed into some alternate reality and let your mind drift while you lay
for hours at a time as a deadly cocktail is pumped into your veins ( constantly
wondering what it actually is and if it works ).

Radiation treatment can also be time consuming and frequent therefore a constant
stress - again having the process explained using VR , and even perhaps applying
it during treatment ( if that was ever possible ) would I believe help immensely.

In conclusion I really hope that this technology can one day become mainstream
in hospitals and firmly believe that as a former cancer patient this will
undeniably help with “the fear” most people have of something that people just
simply don’t understand.
