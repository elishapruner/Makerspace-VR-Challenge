The MakerSpace Virtual Reality Challenge begins January 16 and runs until the end of March. For this challenge, the Richard L'Abbe MakerSpace is partnering with the Ottawa Hospital to create apps in VR that help with patient care during chemotherapy and radiation therapy treatments. This challenge is open to all students from beginners to any level of experience. We will be holding weekly workshops and mentoring sessions to get you up to speed on the latest in VR.  

We are looking for students who have experience in 3D modeling with CAD software (SolidWorks, AutoCAD, Blender, etc), creative students with visual arts experience, and students with software experience (Python, C/C++, C#, Java, etc). If you ever wanted to learn VR this is a great opportunity to team up with other students and create applications with real impact. We will be implementing these apps at the Hospital at the end of the term.

If you are interested in participating in the challenge, the first step is to join the Slack group at: makerspacevrchallenge.slack.com. Slack is the main communication channel for the competition, and anyone with a uOttawa email can join directly. The second step is to come to the workshop sessions. Workshops take place every Wednesday at 6 pm in the Design Commons room (whiteboard room) on the first floor of the STEM building next to the MakerSpace. Workshops are hands-on, bring your laptops and we will build apps for the latest VR headsets together.

Hope to see you at this week's workshop!
